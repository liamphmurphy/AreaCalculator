This program is stupid simple. Below was my initial quick 
writen thoughts of how the program would work.

1. Welcome user to the program.

2. Menu system so user can choose which kind of calculation.
	a. Triangle
	b. Square 
	c. Cylinder
	d. Circle

3. For now, just different if statements for each shape. 
	a. Ask for according variables to solve the calculation.
